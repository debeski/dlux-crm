# Switch Pos Notes (DjangoLux scaffold notes)

## Recommended Structure

- Put project-owned runtime defaults in `DLUX_CONFIG`
- Keep DjangoLux integration in `settings.py` via `dlux_settings(globals())`
- Build full-page forms on `dlux/form_base.html`
- Build list/filter pages on `dlux/list_base.html`
- Use `translations.py`, `forms.py`, `filters.py`, and `tables.py` in each app so discovery stays predictable
- Use `config/celery.py` as the shared Celery entrypoint and keep app tasks in app-local `tasks.py`
- Use `/health/` as the project health endpoint when checking container readiness
- Keep secret bootstrap values in `.secrets/.env`; the generated compose file itself stays in the standard inline-env pattern

## Suggested App Pattern

- Use `ScopedModel` for business models that should inherit DjangoLux audit and scope behavior
- Mark simple lookup datasets with `is_section = True` when they fit the sections workflow
- Use custom views when the model needs a project-owned flow instead of the system sections screen
- Keep shared scripts and CSS in the DjangoLux extension hooks instead of overriding the whole base template when possible

## Useful Commands

- `python manage.py dlux_check`
- `python manage.py dlux_setup`
- `python -m dlux startapp app_name`
- `python -m dlux startapp app_name --register`
- `docker compose -f compose.yml -f compose.dev.yml up`
- `./start.sh -d`
